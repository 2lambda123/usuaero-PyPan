# Introduction

PyPan is a linearized potential flow panel solver. It is currently under active development and improvements are being made regularly. However, it is still mostly in the beta phase of development. If you're using this, please submit feedback so we can improve the interface, functionality, etc.

## Technical Manual

The developers have created an in-depth technical manual which describes the theory and implementation of PyPan. It can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UDHMxPDLgt4fsL51FpNM2gXw7iGktJlw/view?usp=sharing).
